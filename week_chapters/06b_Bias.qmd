## Key Points


**Generalizability and Validity (Accuracy)**

Generally, for a given etiologic research question about whether an exposure causes a disease, it is best to first conduct studies that maximize **internal validity** to establish the direction and size of effects 

  + Then, subsequent studies can be done to assess whether these effects hold true in other populations 
  
Some studies, such as **impact evaluations,** evaluating the impact of a specific program conducted in a specific population at a specific time, do not aim to study etiology, but rather are focused on inferences about that population 

  + In this case, it is often important to design studies to balance both internal and external validity

## Selection Bias

**Selection bias can occur in any type of study**

+ Good study design practices can minimize selection bias in most studies
  
+ Case-control studies are particularly prone to selection bias and warrant a careful assessment of selection bias in the design phase




## Information Bias

**Information bias can result from the way exposure, confounders, or outcomes are measured in any type of study:** Occurs when subjects are misclassified with respect to either exposure or outcome.

  
### Misclassification is the result of information bias
  
+ *Non-differential* misclassification biases results toward the null 

+ *Differential* misclassification biases results in an unknown direction

+ Can result from interviewer bias and/or recall bias
  
+ **Tools to reduce bias:** 

  + Careful study design
  
  + Detailed training and study protocols
  
  + Improve accuracy of collected data by using: 
  
    + multiple measures of exposure and disease
    
    + most accurate information sources as possible
    
    + medical records and lab tests to validate exposure or outcome
    



### Interviewer Bias


    
### Recall Bias
  
+ Exposed subjects are more or less likely to report subsequent diseases

+ Cases more or less likely to report previous exposures

+ **Tools to reduce bias:**

  + Select diseased control group
  
  + Rely on biological or preexisting records for study data
  
  + Design questionnaire so exposure data is complete and accurate
  
  + Ask subjects about prior knowledge of study hypothesis after interview
  
  + Use self-administered or ACASI questionnaire
  
  
  
  
  

  
**Using DAGs to Diagnose Bias**

DAGs are a powerful tool to help diagnose selection and information bias in a study 

To diagnose selection bias, identify whether a selection factor is a collider of the exposure-outcome that is conditioned on in a DAG 

There are many DAG configurations that depict information bias

DAGs are ideally used during the study deisgn phase to help identify, address, and minimize potential bias
