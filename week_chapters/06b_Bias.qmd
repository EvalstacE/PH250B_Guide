## Key Points


![Validity vs Precision](../www/06_images/validity_precision.png)


**Selection bias can occur in any type of study**

  + Good study design practices can minimize selection bias in most studies
  
  + Case-control studies are particularly prone to selection bias and warrant a careful assessment of selection bias in the design phase



**Information bias can result from the way exposure, confounders, or outcomes are measured in any type of study**

  + Careful study design and detailed training and study protocols can help reduce information bias
  
  + Misclassification is the result of information bias
  
  + Non-differential misclassification biases results toward the null 
  
  + Differential misclassification biases results in an unknown direction
  
  
**Generalizability and Validity**

Generally, for a given etiologic research question about whether an exposure causes a disease, it is best to first conduct studies that maximize **internal validity** to establish the direction and size of effects 

  + Then, subsequent studies can be done to assess whether these effects hold true in other populations 
  
Some studies, such as **impact evaluations,** evaluating the impact of a specific program conducted in a specific population at a specific time, do not aim to study etiolgoy, but rather are focussed on interences about that population 

  + In this case, it is often important to design studies to balance both internal and external validity 
  
  
**Using DAGs to Diagnose Bias**

DAGs are a powerful tool to help diagnose selection and information bias in a study 

To diagnose selection bias, identify whether a selection factor is a collider of the exposure-outcome that is conditioned on in a DAG 

There are many DAG configurations that depict information bias

DAGs are ideally used during the study deisgn phase to help identify, address, and minimize potential bias
