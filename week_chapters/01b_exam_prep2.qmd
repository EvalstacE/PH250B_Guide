For bivariable analysis (looking at just two variables at a time), simple hypothesis tests are often preferred over complex regressions.


Chi-square is the standard test for determining if there is an association between two categorical variables in a bivariable setting.

Example: Investigators decide to conduct some exploratory bivariable analyses to answer the following questions. Indicate which statistical test or type of regression they should use for the following:


#### a) Is pet ownership (number of pets) associated with a depression score (PHQ-9 score out of 27)?

Variables: **Continuous outcome (depression score)**; Continuous exposure (number of pets)

Test: Correlation (Pearson) or T-test (if comparing means).

Regression: Linear regression.



#### b) How does depression (coded binary as PHQ-9 score ≤ 4=depression or PHQ-9 > 4=no depression) vary across age (years)?


Variables: **Binary outcome (depression status)** and Continuous exposure (age)

Test: T-test.

Regression: Logistic regression.


#### c) Does depression (coded categorically...) vary across income (coded categorically as falling into four quartiles)?

Variables: **Categorical outcome (depression severity)** and Categorical exposure (income)

Test: **Chi-square test (categorical X, categorical Y)**
