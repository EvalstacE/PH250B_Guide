## Key Points

Following the three principles for case-control studies outlines by *Wacholder et al.* helps to minimize selection bias, confounding, and information bias

We can use a combination of study design and data analysis techniques to meet these principles, including: 

  + Careful selection of controls
  
  + Matching
  
  + Stratification 
  
  + Multivariate statistical models 
  
  + Validation studies
  
  
**There are many potential types of controls**

  + each type of control has different limitations and advantages
  
  + typically we are restricted in the set of potential types of controls we can use, depending on our exposure and disease of interest 
  
  + when selecting controls, we should try to adhere to the three principles for case-control studies as they apply to our research question
  
  
**Case-control study designs estimate different measures of association**

**Various case-control design features exist to:**

  + reduce the cost of conducting the study
  
  + increase the statistical efficiency (e.g., reduce the width of 95% CI)
  
  + Control for unmeasured confounders
