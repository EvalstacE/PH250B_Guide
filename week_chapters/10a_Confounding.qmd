# Confounding


## The Three "Traditional" Criteria for Confounding

  * **Association with Exposure:** The variable must be associated with the exposure (causally or non-causally) in the source population
  
  * **Association with Outcome:** The variable must be an independent cause or predictor of the disease (outcome) among the unexposed.
  
  * **Not an Intermediate:** The variable cannot be on the causal pathway between exposure and disease (it cannot be a mediator)
  
  
**Random Association:** In small studies or randomized trials, confounding can occur purely due to random chance imbalances, even if the variable isn't a "true" cause.

**Surrogates:** You can control for a variable (like Education) that is a surrogate for a hard-to-measure true confounder (like SES)

**Intermediates:** Occasionally, you do control for an intermediate if you are trying to estimate the "Direct Effect" rather than the "Total Effect," though this requires caution.




## Calculations: Identifying Confounding by "Non-Collapsibility"

The primary quantitative skill is comparing the **Crude measure** of association to the **Adjusted (or Stratified)** measure.

### The Logic: 

If the association differs "significantly" (magnitude and/or direction) after you stratify or adjust for a variable, that variable is a confounder.

### The Check:

  * Calculate the Crude Estimate (e.g., OR or RR from the total table).
  
  * Calculate the Stratum-Specific Estimates (e.g., OR for males, OR for females)
  
  * Compare: If the stratum-specific estimates are similar to each other (homogeneity) but different from the crude, confounding is present
  
  
## Classifying the Direction of Confounding


**Positive Confounding:** The Crude estimate is further from the null (1.0) than the Adjusted estimate. It overestimates the effect. for example: 

  * TRUE RR: 2.0
  
  * Crude RR: 3.5

**Negative Confounding:** The Crude estimate is closer to the null (1.0) than the Adjusted estimate. It underestimates the effect

  * TRUE RR: 2.0
  
  * Crude RR: 1.0
  

**Qualitative Confounding:** The direction of the association flips (crossover). It changes from harmful to protective or vice versa

  * TRUE RR: 2.0
  
  * Crude RR: 0.7 (protective)
  




## Using DAGs to Detect Confounding

The "Backdoor Criterion" is the modern method for identifying confounders. It is often more robust than the traditional 3 criteria

The Goal: You want to block all "Backdoor Paths" (paths from Exposure to Outcome that are not the causal path)


### How to select variables for adjustment using a DAG:

**Block Backdoor Paths:** Adjust for variables that close non-causal paths 

(e.g., Common Causes: $Exposure \leftarrow Confounder \rightarrow Outcome$)


**Avoid Colliders:** Do NOT adjust for a collider 

(a node where two arrowheads meet, like $A \rightarrow Z \leftarrow B$).

Critical Concept: 

A collider naturally blocks a path. If you adjust for (condition on) a collider, you open the path and introduce selection bias (sometimes called "collider bias")


**Avoid Descendants:** Do not adjust for variables caused by the exposure (descendants).




## Collinearity (a practical limitation)

Be aware of Collinearity. If a confounder is perfectly correlated with the exposure (e.g., every person with high pollution exposure lives near a freeway, and no one with low pollution lives near a freeway), you cannot adjust for it. There is no variation left in the data to separate the effects (this violates the "positivity" assumption
