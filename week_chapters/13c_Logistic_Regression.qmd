# Logistic Regression


When we have a binary outcome (e.g., disease/no disease) and want to adjust for multiple variables (exposures and confounders), we use Logistic Regression. This model is used to estimate an Odds Ratio (OR).


  * **Outcome**:  Binary (e.g., Yes/No, 1/0).

  * **Independent Variables (Covariates)**: More than one variable (exposure + confounders). Can be continuous or binary.

  * **Measure of Association:** Odds Ratio (OR).
  
  
  
$$\ln\left(\frac{E(Y|X=x)}{1 - E(Y|X=x)}\right) = \text{logit}(E(Y|X=x)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$



  * Left side: The natural log (ln) of the odds of the outcome
  
  * Right side: A linear combination of the coefficients and variables.
  
  
  
  
  
## Interpretation of Coefficients: 

$\beta_1$ (Coefficient on X): This is the log odds ratio comparing the odds of the outcome when $X=1$ to when $X=0$ (for a binary exposure)


$\beta_0$ (Intercept): The log odds of the outcome when all independent variables ($X$) are 0.







## Calculating the Odds Ratio: 


For a Binary Exposure (e.g., $X=1$ vs $X=0$); you simply exponentiate the coefficient


$$\text{OR} = e^{\beta_1} = \exp(\beta_1)$$

Example: If your logistic regression output gives a coefficient for "Smoking" of 0.693:
  
  $$\text{OR} = e^{0.693} \approx 2.0$$

Interpretation: Smokers have 2 times the odds of the outcome compared to non-smokers.




For a Continuous Exposure (e.g., Blood Pressure):

The $\beta$ represents the log odds ratio for a one-unit increase in $X$.


$$\text{OR} = e^{\beta_1}$$

  * represents the multiplicative change in odds for every 1-unit increase in the continuous variable
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
## Logistic Regression for Case-Control Studies


Logistic regression is particularly useful for case-control studies because these studies sample based on disease status (outcome), making risk calculations impossible directly. However, the Odds Ratio calculated from logistic regression is valid


Note: If the disease is rare, this Odds Ratio approximates the Risk Ratio





## Assumptions


Just like linear models, standard logistic regression assumes:


Independence: No clustering or auto-correlation (e.g., no repeated measures on the same person or households).


Linearity in the Logit: For continuous variables, the log odds of the outcome is assumed to change linearly with the variable.






## Summary of Logistic Regression Models: 


  * Outcome: Binary (e.g., Case/Control, Sick/Healthy)

  * Link Function: Logit (Log-Odds)

  * Measure of Association: Odds Ratio (OR)
  
  * Calculation: $\text{OR} = e^{\beta}$

  * Coefficient ($\beta_1$): Log Odds Ratio for a 1-unit change in X

  * Key Assumption: Independence of observations
