# Analaysis of Matched Data 



## Overview: Approaches to Analysis

The method of analysis depends on the *type* of matching used in the study design.

* **Frequency Matching:** Analyzed using standard stratified analysis methods.

* **Pair Matching:** Requires special methods that account for the dependent nature of the data (pairs).




## 1. Analyzing Frequency Matched Data

When data is frequency matched (e.g., ensuring 50% females in both cases and controls), you use **typical stratification methods**.

* **Method:** Stratify by the matching variable (e.g., sex).

* **Calculation:** Use the standard weighted average formulas (like Mantel-Haenszel) to calculate the adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) or Risk Ratio (RR).

* **Control:** You *must* control for the matching factor in the analysis to remove the selection bias introduced by matching (specifically in case-control studies).





## 2. Analyzing Pair Matched Data

In pair matching, the unit of analysis is the **pair**, not the individual. There are only two observations per stratum (one case, one control).

### The Matched-Pair 2x2 Table

Unlike the standard 2x2 table, this table counts **pairs**, not individuals.

| | **Control Exposed** | **Control Unexposed** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Case Exposed** | $a$ (Concordant) | $b$ (Discordant) |
| **Case Unexposed** | $c$ (Discordant) | $d$ (Concordant) |


* **Concordant Pairs ($a, d$):** Both case and control have the *same* exposure status. These provide **no information** about the relationship between exposure and disease.

* **Discordant Pairs ($b, c$):** Case and control have *different* exposure status. This is where the information lies.



### A. Case-Control Studies: Matched Odds Ratio
In a matched case-control study, the Odds Ratio is calculated using **only the discordant pairs**.

$$ OR_{matched} = \frac{b}{c} $$

* **$b$:** Pairs where Case is Exposed, Control is Unexposed.

* **$c$:** Pairs where Case is Unexposed, Control is Exposed.

* **Intuition:** If exposure causes disease, we expect more pairs where the Case is the one exposed ($b$) than pairs where the Control is the one exposed ($c$).




### B. Cohort Studies: Matched Risk Ratio

In a matched cohort study, the layout and formula are different because groups are defined by exposure, not outcome.

$$ RR_{matched} = \frac{\text{Proportion of Exposed with Disease}}{\text{Proportion of Unexposed with Disease}} $$

Formula using pair counts (where $A, B, C, D$ refer to different pair configurations in a cohort layout):

$$ RR = \frac{A + B}{A + C} $$


*(Note: Refer to the specific lecture slide for the cohort table layout, as it differs from the case-control table)*.





## 3. "Breaking the Match"

What happens if you ignore the matching and analyze the data as if it were an unmatched study?

### Case-Control Studies

* **Consequence:** Breaking the match produces a **biased estimate** (usually towards the null).

* **Rule:** **Never break the match** in a pair-matched case-control study. You must use matched analysis techniques (e.g., conditional logistic regression).

* *Exception:* You can convert pair matching to frequency matching (e.g., matching on age) as long as you stratify by that variable in the analysis.







### Cohort Studies

* **Consequence:** Breaking the match usually yields a **valid point estimate** (unbiased) because matching in cohorts removes confounding.

* **Caveat:** The variance estimates (Confidence Intervals) will be incorrect (usually too wide) because the analysis ignores the correlation between pairs.

* **Rule:** You generally *can* break the match to get the RR, but matched analysis is preferred for correct precision.
