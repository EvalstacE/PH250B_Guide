# Overmatching




## Overview: What is Overmatching?

Overmatching occurs when you match on a variable that is **not a confounder**. This can lead to increased cost, loss of statistical efficiency, or even the introduction of bias that cannot be fixed in the analysis.

**Goal:** Use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in the **design phase** to identify and avoid matching on variables that will cause these problems.



Issue with overmatching: 


#### When you match on a variable that’s strongly predictive of exposure (but not a confounder):

**you’re making the exposure almost deterministic within your matched sets**. 

That means:

  * There’s less variation in exposure among your matched subjects,
  
  * Which means less ability to detect a difference in outcomes by exposure status,
  
  * Even if the exposure truly causes the outcome!
  
  
  
##### When you match on a mediator:

**you're conditioning on a variable on the causal path from exposure to outcome** 
  
That means:

  * you’re **blocking part of the causal effect** of the exposure
  
  * you make the exposure and outcome look artificially unassociated
  
  * not because there’s no effect, but *because you've matched away the pathway through which the effect operates*
  
  
  
**Matching on a predictor of exposure (that isn't a confounder) reduces exposure variation** and hurts identification. 

**Matching on a mediator blocks the effect pathway**, and also hurts identification.


**Both lead to underestimating or even missing the true causal effect**



## 1. Overmatching that Harms Statistical Efficiency (Precision)

This type of overmatching reduces the precision of your effect estimate (wider confidence intervals) without reducing bias.

The Theory: In a matched analysis, we only learn from discordant pairs (pairs where Case and Control have different exposures)


Recall the formula: $\text{Matched OR} = b/c$ (discordant pairs).

If you match on a variable that is strongly correlated with the Exposure (but isn't a confounder), you force the Control to have the same Exposure status as the Case.

This minimizes the number of discordant pairs. If $b$ and $c$ drop to near zero, your statistical power vanishes.



### the "Coffee" example: 

  * **Exposure:** Coffee Drinking. Outcome: Bladder Cancer.

  * **Matching Variable:** Consumption of Cream Substitutes (strongly correlated with coffee, but doesn't cause cancer).

If you match a Coffee-Drinking Case to a Control who uses Cream Substitutes, that Control is also almost certainly a Coffee Drinker.

* **Result:** You have a Concordant Pair (Both Exposed). You toss it out. You lose data. You wasted time and money finding a control that provided zero statistical information.






### The DAG Structure

* **Scenario:** The matching variable is associated with the **Exposure** but **NOT** the **Disease** (outcome).

* **Why it's bad:** By matching on this variable, you force the controls to look like the cases with regard to the exposure. This reduces the variation in exposure between cases and controls, which is necessary to estimate the effect.

* **Result:** Loss of information and statistical power. The stratified analysis (required by matching) was unnecessary because the variable wasn't a confounder.


**Example DAG:**

## 2. Overmatching that Harms Validity (Accuracy)

This is the most dangerous form of overmatching because it introduces **bias** (selection bias) that generally **cannot be corrected** in the analysis.



### Scenario A: Matching on a Collider

* **Definition:** A variable that is affected by *both* the Exposure and the Disease (or sharing common causes with both).

* **The DAG:** Exposure $\rightarrow$ Matching Variable $\leftarrow$ Disease.

* **The Mechanism:** Matching conditions on the collider. This opens a "backdoor path" between exposure and disease, creating a spurious association (bias).

### Scenario B: Matching on an Intermediate

* **Definition:** A variable that lies on the causal pathway between Exposure and Disease.

* **The DAG:** Exposure $\rightarrow$ Matching Variable $\rightarrow$ Disease.

* **The Mechanism:** By matching on the intermediate, you are essentially holding it constant. This blocks the causal path you are trying to study, biasing the total effect estimate toward the null.

## Summary of DAG Guidelines for Matching

When selecting matching variables, draw your DAG and check the following criteria:

| DAG Structure | Decision | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exposure $\leftarrow$ Match $\rightarrow$ Disease** | **MATCH** | This is a Confounder. Matching closes the backdoor path and reduces bias. |
| **Exposure $\leftrightarrow$ Match (No link to Disease)** | **DO NOT MATCH** | Reduces statistical efficiency. Unnecessary stratification. |
| **Exposure $\rightarrow$ Match $\leftarrow$ Disease** | **DO NOT MATCH** | This is a Collider. Matching opens a backdoor path and introduces selection bias. |
| **Exposure $\rightarrow$ Match $\rightarrow$ Disease** | **DO NOT MATCH** | This is an Intermediate. Matching blocks the causal effect you are trying to measure. |





### Critical:

If you identify overmatching that harms *validity* (collider or intermediate) in a study design, note that this bias **cannot be fixed** in the analysis phase. It must be avoided during the design phase.
