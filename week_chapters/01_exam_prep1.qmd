## Survival Analysis (Cox Regression & Kaplan-Meier)

Expect to see Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression output tables. 
You will likely be asked to:

**Interpret Kaplan-Meier Curves:** Describe the trends in survival over time between two groups (e.g., "curves diverge at the end," or "Group A has shorter average survival").

**Check Assumptions:** Specifically, the Proportional Hazards assumption. You may be asked if a Cox model is appropriate given a graph where curves cross (the answer is usually no because the hazard ratio is not constant 1).
  
**Calculate Hazard Ratios (HR):** Calculate the HR from regression coefficients ($e^\beta$) and interpret it (e.g., "Group 2 has 2.36 times the hazard of dying compared to Group 1")
  
**Interaction in Survival Models:** Calculate an HR for a specific subgroup when an interaction term is present. This involves summing the relevant coefficients before exponentiating: $e^{\beta_1 + \beta_3}$


  
  
#### Example 1: 

##### Your colleague is considering modeling the data from this trial with Cox regression. Do you concur with his analysis plan? Discuss the assumptions of Cox regression to support your answer.

  * You should disagree with your colleague’s suggestion, because Cox regression relies on the assumption of proportional hazards—that the hazard ratio between the treatment arms is constant over time (the hazard in the exposed is a multiple of the baseline hazard (h1(t)=h0*B)). This is demonstrably false, because the curves cross and the distance between the curves changes over time. Therefore, the assumption is violated and you should not use Cox regression (at least not without accounting for the interaction with time).   
  
  
  
  
##### Another colleague is worried about the Cox model for these data because she suspects that the baseline hazard, h0(t), does not fit the appropriate distribution. How do you respond to the colleague? 

  * The Cox model makes no assumption about the form or underlying distribution of the hazard. Therefore, the colleague’s concern is not an issue. The violation of the proportional hazards assumption is the problem here. 
  
  
  
  
**Tip:**  Look for crossing lines. If the survival curves cross, the hazard rate of one group is not consistently higher or lower than the other.

  * Example Answer: *"No. Cox regression relies on the proportional hazards assumption—that the hazard ratio is constant over time. This is demonstrably false here because the curves cross; therefore, the assumption is violated."*

##### Calculate and interpret the hazard ratio for Group 2

  * Formula: $HR = e^{\beta}$
  
  * Calculation: $e^{0.859} \approx 2.36$
  
  * HR = e^0.859 = 2.361 
  
  * Group 2 (history of CHD) has 2.36 times the hazard of dying of Group 1 (no history of CHD), adjusting for age. 
  
  
##### TIPS: 

**Answer format:**  *Group [X] has [HR] times the hazard of [outcome] compared to Group [Y], adjusting for [covariates]* 

* Use the word "Hazard" or "Rate".

* Do NOT use the word "Risk" (Risk is cumulative; Hazard is instantaneous)

* Do NOT say "adjusting for treatment" if treatment is your main exposure; you adjust for confounders (like age)
  
  
##### What type of analysis uses Cox proportional hazards models? What do these types of models “control” for, or take into account, that logistic regression for example doesn’t address? 


  * Survival analysis: These types of models take into account time at risk 
  
  
  
  
  
  
#### Example 2: 
  
##### The Kaplan-Meier (unadjusted survival curves) curves in the graph below depict time-to-death (in days) in a study of lung cancer patients. Describe in 1-2 sentences what the two curves appear to show


![](images/kaplanmeier2.png)
  
  
  

  *   The curves appear to indicate that older cancer patients (those over 60 years old) have shorter average survival time than do younger cancer patients. Although the two curves are largely similar for most of the follow-up period, they diverge at the end and younger patients appear to survive longer than older patients.
  
  
  
  
  
![](images/coxtable2.png)  
  
  
##### Interpret this Hazard Ratio in words.   

  * The hazard of death among older lung cancer patients is 1.34 times the hazard of death among younger lung cancer patients.
  
  
  
##### Using all the relevant information presented in the output above, in 1-2 sentences, state what you conclude about the relationship between age and the relative hazard of dying in lung cancer patients  


  * Although the HR is greater than 1.0, the 95% confidence interval includes the null value of 1.0, and its associated p-value is greater than the conventional level of significance (alpha=0.05). This indicates that the relationship between age and hazard of death among lung cancer patients is not statistically significant (we cannot exclude the role of chance).
  
  
  
##### Cox Proportional Hazards for infertility treatment


![](images/coxtable3.png)
  
##### Calculate a measure of association for the treatment among women over 35


This is an example when we need to calculate an HR when an interaction term is present. 


  * You cannot just take $e^{\beta_1}$. You must add the interaction coefficient because the woman is both treated and over 35.
  
  * Formula: $HR = \frac{e^{(\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3)}}{e^{\beta_2}} = e^{(\beta_1 + \beta_3)}$
  
    * You sum the coefficients for the exposure ($\beta_1$) and the interaction ($\beta_3$) , then exponentiate that
    
  * Calculation: If $\beta_1 = 1.43$ and $\beta_3 = -0.86$ , then:
  
    * $HR = e^{(1.43 - 0.86)} = e^{0.57} \approx 1.77$


![](images/coxtable3_solution.png)
  
  
  
**Interpretation:** 

Among women over 35, exposure to this treatment was associated with 1.77 times the ‘hazard’ of getting pregnant.


##### What assumptions must hold for this result to be valid?


  1.  The **measure of association captures a constant ratio over time for any combination of the covariates** (age >35 and treatment)
  
  2.  Women **withdrawing from the study have the same instantaneous potential of the outcome as remaining women**, conditional on age


Explanations: 

  1. This is the definition of proportional hazards – the hazard ratio is constant between two levels of exposure / covariates. In this setting, we are estimating a stratum-specific HR, one that is only for women over 35 and one for women under 35. We do not require exchangeable groups across levels of this effect modifier. Remember in module 1, we talked about reporting separate estimates when effect modification is present to reflect the fact that the groups are hypothesized to be different from each other.
  
  2. This is the assumption of independent censoring applied to this study

## Meta-Analysis & Systematic Reviews

You will almost certainly see Forest Plots and Funnel Plots

* **Forest Plots:** Identify the plot type, interpret the individual study estimates (squares) and the pooled estimate (diamond), and assess heterogeneity visually.

* **Funnel Plots:** Identify them and determine if publication bias is present. Look for asymmetry, specifically missing small studies with null or negative results

* **Fixed vs. Random Effects:** Distinguish between them. 

  * Know that Fixed Effects assume a single common effect, while Random Effects assume studies estimate different effects and are usually more conservative (wider CIs)
  
* **Weighting:** Understand that studies with smaller variance (narrower confidence intervals, larger sample size) get more weight







## Advanced Analytic Methods (Propensity Scores, G-Computation, IPTW)

These questions focus on the logic and interpretation rather than manual calculation of the models.

* **Propensity Scores:** Define them (predicted probability of exposure given covariates) and their use (mimicking randomization to control for confounding).

* **G-Computation:** Understand the steps (model outcome, predict $Y_1$ and $Y_0$ for everyone) and that it allows for estimating marginal (population) effects

* **IPTW (Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting)**: Know the first step is modeling the exposure (not outcome) to create weights. Understand that weighting creates a pseudo-population where confounders are balanced

* **Counterfactuals**: Write equations using counterfactual notation, such as $E[Y_1 - Y_0]$ for the causal risk difference







## Regression & Interaction


* **Model Selection:** Choose the correct test for specific variable types (e.g., Chi-square for two categorical variables, ANOVA for categorical X and continuous Y, Logistic for binary outcome)

* **Interaction vs. Confounding:** Interpret coefficients in models with interaction terms. If the interaction term ($X*W$) is significant, effect modification is present. You may be asked to calculate the effect of exposure at different levels of the modifier

* **Interpreting Coefficients:** Standard interpretation questions for Logistic ("log odds") and Linear ("change in mean Y") regression







## Sample Size and Power

* **Parameter Relationships**: Questions asking how changing one parameter affects others (e.g., "Increasing sample size increases power," "Decreasing variability increases power").

* **Calculate power or sample size using provided formulas and Z-tables**. Expect to handle one-sided vs. two-sided tests (which changes the Z-score used)

* **Interpretation:** accurately interpret power in a sentence (e.g., "The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true"


Example: 


Researchers at UC Berkeley are interested in the effects of a prenatal support and education program on preterm birth. They plan to test the program in a pilot study to determine if they should recommend that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) implement the program statewide. 

**The current risk of preterm birth in California is 11%**. 

(p of group 2 = 0.11)

For CDPH to recommend implementing the program throughout the state, they have stated that 

the risk of preterm birth among those receiving the intervention **needs to be 9% or lower**. 

(p of group 1 = 0.09)

The researchers decide to use a concurrent cohort design to investigate this relationship in the pilot study.


Using a relative measure of association, what is the minimum total sample size needed to detect the association that would support statewide implementation of the program as described above? 

Note that the exposed group are those who received the intervention. 

For notation, the exposed will be called “Group 1”, and the unexposed will be called group “Group 2". 

Use a **2-tailed statistical test with an alpha level of 0.05 and 80% power.**



**Calculations:**

#### First, we establish the Cumulative Incidence Ratio ($CIR$) or Relative Risk ($RR$)

$$CIR = \frac{p_{Group1}}{p_{Group2}} = \frac{0.09}{0.11} \approx 0.8182$$



#### Next, we apply the course formula for sample size per arm ($n$)


$$n = \frac{(Z_{1-\beta} + Z_{1-\alpha/2})^2 [ (CIR + 1) - p_{Group2}(CIR^2 + 1) ]}{p_{Group2}(1 - CIR)^2}$$

##### Where: 

Z-score Sum: $(0.84 + 1.96)^2 = (2.8)^2 = 7.84$
  
Numerator Bracket:

* $CIR + 1 = 1.8182$

* $p_{Group2}(CIR^2 + 1) = 0.11 \times (0.8182^2 + 1) \approx 0.11 \times 1.6695 \approx 0.1836$

* Bracket Total: $1.8182 - 0.1836 = 1.6346$


Denominator:

$p_{Group2}(1 - CIR)^2 = 0.11 \times (1 - 0.8182)^2 = 0.11 \times (0.1818)^2 \approx 0.11 \times 0.03305 \approx 0.003636$



Solving for $n$:


$$n = \frac{7.84 \times 1.6346}{0.003636} \approx \frac{12.815}{0.003636} \approx 3524.5$$



Rounding up to the nearest whole person, we require **3,525 participants per group.**





$Z_{1-\alpha/2}$: 1.96 

* This corresponds to a two-sided test with an alpha ($\alpha$) of 0.05.
  
  
$Z_{1-\beta}$: 0.84

* This corresponds to 80% power ($\beta = 0.20$)


$p_{Group1}$ (Risk in exposed): 0.09

* This is the target risk level (9%) required for the intervention to be successful.

$p_{Group2}$ (Risk in unexposed): 0.11

* This is the current background risk (11%).



After establishing the sample size needed from Q4.1, the researchers apply for a grant and receive enough funds to deliver the intervention to 5000 mothers, with 5000 control mothers for comparison. What will happen to the power to detect the association described above, assuming that alpha remains unchanged? 


**The power to detect the association will increase** 

Since the funded sample size (5,000 per group) is larger than the minimum required sample size calculated previously (approximately 3,525 per group), the study will have greater than 80% power to detect the specified difference.


increasing the sample size while holding other parameters (like effect size and alpha) fixed always results in an increase in power. This occurs because a larger sample size reduces the standard error, making it easier to statistically distinguish the observed difference from the null hypothesis




--------------------------



## Spillover and Reproducibility

* **Distinguish Intention-to-Treat (randomized assignment) from Spillover (effect on untreated in treated clusters)**

* **Reproducibility Crisis**: Know definitions of p-hacking (data dredging), pre-specified analysis plans (to minimize bias), and study registration
