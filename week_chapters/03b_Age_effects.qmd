## Age Effects

age effects are defined as the change in the measure of disease according to age, irrespective of birth, cohort, and calendar time.

For age effects, for almost all conditions, a person's age is associated with risk. So this doesn't necessarily mean that risk goes up with age. For some conditions, risk will go down with age. But if there's a relationship between age and the rate or prevalence of disease, we refer to that as an age effect.
