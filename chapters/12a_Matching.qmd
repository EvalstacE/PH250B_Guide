## 1. Introduction to Matching


### What is Matching?
Matching is the selection of a reference series (e.g., controls in a case-control study or unexposed in a cohort study) that is nearly identical to the index series with respect to one or more potential confounders.


* **Goal:** To improve the quality of the **counterfactual** by making study groups more comparable.


### Why Match?
Beyond reducing confounding, matching is used to:

1.  **Increase Statistical Efficiency (Precision):** Prevents situations where confounder distributions are dramatically different between groups (e.g., all cases are old, all controls are young).

2.  **Increase Statistical Power:** Particularly in small case-control studies, ensuring sufficient controls in important subgroups.

3.  **Feasibility:** Practical reasons during enrollment (e.g., selecting the "next birth" as a control in a hospital study).



### Types of Matching


* **Individual (Pair) Matching:** Matching specific subjects based on characteristics (e.g., for every 25-year-old male case, find a 25-year-old male control).


* **Frequency Matching:** Matching the *distribution* of characteristics (e.g., if 30% of cases are women, ensure 30% of controls are women).


* **Distance Matching:** Using algorithms (like propensity scores) to find the "closest" match based on multiple variables in multidimensional space.




### Matching in Different Study Designs

| Study Design | Method | Purpose/Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cohort** | Match Exposed to Unexposed | **Removes confounding** in the design phase. Analysis does not require special adjustment for the matched factor. |
| **Case-Control** | Match Cases to Controls | **Does NOT remove confounding** (can introduce selection bias). *Must* use a matched analysis (stratification) to fix this. Primarily done to improve efficiency. |
| **Trials** | Block Randomization | Matches participants by block (e.g., geography) before randomizing. Increases efficiency. |




### Disadvantages of Matching

* **Cost/Complexity:** Can make sampling difficult.

* **Exclusion:** If no match is found for a case, that case might be excluded (reduces N).

* **Reduced Flexibility:** You **cannot estimate the association** of the matched variable with the outcome (e.g., if you match on age, you can't study age as a risk factor).

* **Overmatching:** Improper matching can obscure the effect of interest (discussed in future lectures).







## 2. Numerical Examples of Matching

### A. Matching in a Cohort Study

In a cohort study, matching manipulates the **exposure** distribution .

* **Scenario:** A crude analysis of a population shows a Risk Ratio (RR) of 33 due to strong confounding by gender (90% of exposed are men, 10% of unexposed are men).

* **The Match:** We design the study to select unexposed subjects such that their gender distribution **matches** the exposed group (e.g., taking a 10% sample of exposed men and ensuring the unexposed sample is also 90% male).

* **Result:** The new Crude RR becomes 10, which matches the stratum-specific RRs.

* **Takeaway:** Matching on a confounder in a cohort study **removes confounding**. You do *not* need to adjust for the matched variable in the analysis.






### B. Matching in a Case-Control Study

In a case-control study, matching manipulates the **disease** (case/control) distribution.

* **Scenario:** We match controls to cases based on gender.

* **The Problem:** By forcing the controls to look like the cases regarding gender (a confounder associated with exposure), we inadvertently make the controls look more like the cases regarding the *exposure* as well. This biases the crude association toward the null.

* **Result:** A crude analysis of the matched data yields an Odds Ratio (OR) of 5.0, which is biased (lower than the true OR of 10).

* **The Fix:** You **must stratify** (perform a matched analysis) to obtain the correct estimate. When stratified by the matching factor, the OR returns to 10.

* **Takeaway:** Matching in a case-control study does **not** remove confounding; it actually introduces a selection bias that must be corrected by stratifying on the matched variable in the analysis.





### "Breaking the Match"

* **Cohort Studies:** If you ignore the matching (break the match) in the analysis, the point estimate remains valid, though variance estimates (CIs) may be incorrect.

* **Case-Control Studies:** If you ignore the matching in the analysis, you will produce a **biased estimate**. You generally **cannot** break the match in case-control studies.
