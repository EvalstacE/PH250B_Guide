# Detecting Additive Scale Interaction 


## Overview: Why Focus on the Additive Scale?

While statistical interaction can be assessed on both additive and relative scales, the **additive scale** is generally preferred for assessing **biologic or causal interaction**.

* **Causal Link:** As discussed in the Potential Outcomes section, departures from additivity (heterogeneity of the Risk Difference) imply the presence of causal interactive types in the population.


* **Public Health Impact:** Additive interaction helps identify subgroups where an intervention would have the largest absolute impact (e.g., preventing the most cases).






## 1. Basic Assessment: Homogeneity of the Risk Difference

The most straightforward way to detect additive interaction is to compare the **Observed Joint Risk Difference** to the **Expected Joint Risk Difference** (assuming additivity).





### Formula for Interaction


We can define the amount of interaction as the difference between the observed and expected effects:

$$ Interaction_{additive} = RD_{observed} - RD_{expected} $$

Substituting the probabilities (risks) $p_{xz}$ where $x$ is exposure A and $z$ is exposure B:

* **Observed RD (Both present):** $p_{11} - p_{00}$

* **Expected RD (Sum of individual):** $(p_{10} - p_{00}) + (p_{01} - p_{00})$



**Interaction Formula:**

$$ (p_{11} - p_{00}) - [(p_{10} - p_{00}) + (p_{01} - p_{00})] $$

This simplifies to:

$$ p_{11} - p_{10} - p_{01} + p_{00} $$





### Interpretation (For Harmful Exposures)

Assuming both exposures increase risk:

* **Result > 0:** **Positive (Synergistic) Interaction.** The combined effect is greater than the sum of individual effects. Public health interventions on one factor will have a *larger* benefit in the group exposed to the other factor.

* **Result = 0:** **No Interaction.** The combined effect equals the sum of individual effects.

* **Result < 0:** **Negative (Antagonistic) Interaction.** The combined effect is less than the sum of individual effects.





## 2. Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI)

In many studies (e.g., Case-Control), we may only have ratio measures like **Risk Ratios (RR)** or **Odds Ratios (OR)**, not absolute risks. We can still assess additive interaction using **RERI**.



### Derivation

Start with the additive interaction formula:

$$ p_{11} - p_{10} - p_{01} + p_{00} $$

Divide the entire formula by the baseline risk ($p_{00}$):

$$ \frac{p_{11}}{p_{00}} - \frac{p_{10}}{p_{00}} - \frac{p_{01}}{p_{00}} + \frac{p_{00}}{p_{00}} $$

This converts the risks into Risk Ratios (RR):

$$ RERI = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1 $$





### Interpretation of RERI (Harmful Exposures)

* **RERI > 0:** Positive (Synergistic) interaction on the additive scale.

* **RERI = 0:** No additive interaction.

* **RERI < 0:** Negative (Antagonistic) interaction on the additive scale.

*Note: For preventive exposures, the signs for interpretation are reversed (e.g., RERI < 0 implies synergy).*




### Using Odds Ratios (Case-Control Studies)

If the outcome is rare, you can substitute Odds Ratios (OR) for Risk Ratios in the formula:

$$ RERI \approx OR_{11} - OR_{10} - OR_{01} + 1 $$







## Summary of Key Points


**Method:** We formalize the assessment of interaction by comparing Observed vs. Expected joint effects.


**Advantage of RERI:** It allows you to detect **additive scale interaction** (which implies biological interaction) even when you are using **relative scale measures** (RR or OR) from regression models.


**Significance:** Modern software can calculate confidence intervals for RERI to determine if the additive interaction is statistically significant.
