# Population_Intervention_Effects

Population intervention effects are causal effects that compare the observed population risk (or outcome) to the risk under a specific, realistic counterfactual intervention scenario

Population intervention effects are a critical tool because they move us away from theoretical "all-or-nothing" comparisons toward policy-relevant questions.


### The Motivation (Why do we need this?)

Traditional measures like the Risk Difference (RD) usually compare a scenario where 100% of the population is treated ($R_e$) versus 0% treated ($R_u$).

The Problem: In the real world, it is rarely feasible to treat everyone (100%) or no one (0%). Therefore, $R_e$ and $R_u$ are often unrealistic scenarios.

The Solution: We need a parameter that lets us define customized, realistic scenarios (e.g., "What if we increased vaccination from the current 40% to 80%?")


#### The Comparison: Instead of 100% vs. 0%, we compare:

  1. Observed Scenario ($R_0$): The risk under current, real-world conditions (e.g., 40% coverage)
  
  2. Ideal/Realistic Scenario ($R_I$): The risk under a hypothetical but achievable intervention target (e.g., 80% coverage)
  


**Formula:** $$\text{Population Intervention Effect} = R_I - R_0$$


*Note: It can also be calculated as a ratio* 


**Magnitude Note:**

The Population Intervention Effect will typically be smaller than the Risk Difference because the contrast (e.g., 40% vs. 80%) is narrower than the full contrast (0% vs. 100%).




## Comparison with Other Parameters


| Parameter | Formula | Comparison | Realism & Usage |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Risk Difference (RD)** | $R_e - R_u$ | **100% Exposed** ($R_e$) vs. **0% Exposed** ($R_u$) | [cite_start]**Least Realistic:** It assumes perfect implementation (100% coverage), which is rarely achievable[cite: 2096, 2136]. |
| **Pop. Attributable Fraction (PAF)** | $(R_t - R_u) / R_t$ | **Observed** ($R_t$) vs. **0% Exposed** ($R_u$) | [cite_start]**Intermediate:** More realistic than RD because it uses the current exposure level ($R_t$), but still compares against an unrealistic 0% exposed counterfactual[cite: 1991, 2141]. |
| **Pop. Intervention Effect** | $R_I - R_0$ | **Ideal Target** ($R_I$) vs. **Observed** ($R_0$) | **Most Realistic:** Directly answers the policy question: "How much impact would we see if we reached our target coverage?" (e.g., 40% vs 80%) [cite_start][cite: 2064, 2143]. |






## Calculation Method: G-Computation


We use G-computation to estimate these effects. There are 5 key steps: 


1. **Model:** 

Estimate the association between the exposure and outcome using a regression model, adjusting for confounders


2. **Predict Counterfactuals:** 

Use the model coefficients to predict outcomes for every individual in the dataset under two specific scenarios:

  * Counterfactual Scenario 1 ($R_I$): Set exposure to the "Ideal" level (e.g., everyone who meets specific criteria gets treated)
  
  * Counterfactual Scenario 2 ($R_0$): Set exposure to the "Observed" level (often just the original data)
  
  
3. **Estimate Population Risk:**

Calculate the average of these predicted probabilities/outcomes for the entire population under Scenario 1 and Scenario 2

4. **Calculate Effect:**

Take the difference (or ratio) of the two population averages ($R_I - R_0$)


5. **Inference:**

Use bootstrapping to obtain 95% confidence intervals (because standard errors are difficult to calculate analytically here)




## Key Take-aways


Definition & Interpretation: Be able to define a population intervention effect. It allows us to define customized counterfactual scenarios tailored to a specific research question.


Exam Tip: Be ready to interpret a result. 

"The result ($R_I - R_0$) estimates the reduction in disease incidence if the program had reached its target coverage (80%) compared to the observed coverage (40%)"


Why choose it? Be prepared to explain why you would use this over RD or PAF. The keywords are "realistic" and "policy-relevant." It avoids unrealistic assumptions like 100% compliance


Examples: Recognize scenarios where this applies: 

  * Example: HIV PrEP campaigns reaching 85% of targets vs. current levels
  
  * Example: Comparing neighborhoods with high vs. low density of alcohol outlets
  
  
Methodology: Remember that G-computation is the tool used for estimation and that bootstrapping is required for confidence intervals.
