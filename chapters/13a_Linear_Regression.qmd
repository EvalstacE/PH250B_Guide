# Linear Regression


## When to Use Linear Regression

You typically choose a linear regression model based on the type of outcome (dependent) variable you have: 

* **Outcome Type:** Continuous (e.g., height-for-age Z-score, blood pressure, weight).

* **Measure of Association:** Mean Difference

* **Identity Function:** Identity Link (we model the outcome directly, without transformation).


**Important Note:** While it is mathematically possible to model risks or rates with linear regression, it is generally avoided because the model can predict impossible values (e.g., risk < 0 or > 1)


## The Bivariable Linear Model:


$$E(Y|X=x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$


  * $E(Y|X=x)$: The expected mean of the outcome $Y$ given exposure $X$
  
  * $\beta_0$ (Intercept): The mean of the outcome $Y$ when the exposure $X = 0$ (the unexposed/reference group)
  
  * $\beta_1$ (Slope): The Mean Difference in the outcome $Y$ for a one-unit change in $X$
  
  
### Interpretting the Coefficients: 


**Scenario A: Binary Exposure (e.g., Treatment vs. Control)**

If $X$ is binary ($0 = \text{Unexposed}$, $1 = \text{Exposed}$):

  * $\beta_0$: The mean outcome among the unexposed
  
  * $\beta_1$: The difference in the mean outcome between the exposed ($X=1$) and unexposed ($X=0$)
  
  
**Scenario B: Continuous Exposure (e.g., Weight in kg)**

If $X$ is continuous:

  * $\beta_1$: The change in the mean outcome for a one-unit increase in $X$
  
**NOTE:** Sometimes a "one-unit increase" (e.g., 1 gram of weight) is too small to be meaningful. 

  * You may need to calculate the effect of a larger shift (e.g., 10 units or 1 Standard Deviation). 
  
  * To do this, simply multiply the coefficient by the amount of the shift (e.g., $\beta_1 \times 10$)
  
  
  
### Calculating the Mean Difference (the "Plug-In" Method)

You should be able to derive the mean difference using the coefficients. The professors emphasize "plugging in" values to prove the interpretation.

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:

To find the Mean Difference comparing Exposed ($X=1$) to Unexposed ($X=0$):

  1. Write the Model: $E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$
  
  2. Calculate Mean for Exposed ($X=1$):
  
    * $$\beta_0 + \beta_1(1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$
    
  3. Calculate Mean for Unexposed ($X=0$)
  
    * $$\beta_0 + \beta_1(0) = \beta_0$$
    
  4. Subtract (Exposed - Unexposed):
  
    * $$(\beta_0 + \beta_1) - (\beta_0) = \beta_1$$
    
  **RESULT:** The Mean Difference is equal to $\beta_1$

## Multivariable Linear Regression (Adjusting for Confounding)

When we add more variables (covariates) to adjust for confounding, the interpretation changes slightly.


$$E(Y|X, Z) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 Z$$


(Where $X$ is exposure and $Z$ is a confounder)


  * $\beta_1$: The difference in the mean outcome comparing exposed vs. unexposed, holding $Z$ constant (or adjusting for $Z$)
  
  * $\beta_2$: The difference in the mean outcome comparing levels of $Z$, holding exposure $X$ constant
  
  
  
  
--------------------------


  
## Interaction in Linear Models

If we suspect interaction (effect modification), we add a **product term** (interaction term; measure of effect modification) to the model.



$$E(Y|X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 (X_1 \cdot X_2)$$


$\beta_3$ (Interaction Term): This coefficient assesses the presence of interaction


Interpretation: $\beta_3$ represents the difference between the observed joint effect of $X_1$ and $X_2$ and the expected joint effect (sum of individual effects)


Scale: Linear regression models assess interaction on the **Additive Scale**


### Assessing Interaction:

  * If $\beta_3 > 0$: Positive interaction (synergy)
  
  * If $\beta_3 < 0$: Negative interaction (antagonism)
  
  * If $\beta_3 = 0$: No interaction
  
  
  
  
---------------------------  
  
  
## Key Take-Aways: 


Independence: The model assumes data are independent. It assumes NO clustering (e.g., people within households) and NO auto-correlation (repeated measures on the same person over time).

  * If clustering exists: You must use Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) or Mixed Models
  


Linearity: The model assumes a straight-line relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It assumes a 1-unit increase in X has the same effect on Y regardless of the starting value of X


Extrapolation: Be cautious when interpreting results outside the range of observed data (e.g., predicting height for a weight of 0 kg)
