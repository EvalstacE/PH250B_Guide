## Sufficient Cause Models
Each total pie = sufficient cause
Each slice in a pie = component cause
Slice that appears in all sufficient cause models = necessary cause
Completion of sufficient cause = onset of disease
Components can occur at different times
Blocking a component prevents disease for a particular sufficient cause

## Counterfactual Framework
Ideal study design = going back in time with the same people
