# Systematic Review and Meta-analysis


## Systematic Reviews

A systematic review is a rigorous, reproducible method to identify, evaluate, and synthesize all available evidence on a specific research question. Unlike a narrative review, which is subjective and relies on an expert's selection of studies, a systematic review follows a strict protocol to minimize bias


### Key characteristics: 


  * **Protocol-Driven:**  It starts with a written protocol defining the research question, search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and risk of bias assessment.


  * **Reproducible:**  Another researcher should be able to follow your protocol and find the same studies.


  * **Comprehensive:** Aims to find all relevant studies, typically searching multiple databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, etc.).


  * **Objective:** Inclusion decisions are based on pre-defined criteria, often involving two independent reviewers to reduce subjectivity.
  
  
### Systematic Review Steps:

#### 1. Write Protocol: 

Define the study question (often using PICOS: Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design).


#### 2. Search Literature: 

Execute comprehensive search queries in databases.


#### 3. Screening: 

Review titles, abstracts, and full texts against eligibility criteria.


#### 4. Abstract Data: 

Extract relevant data (estimates, sample sizes, etc.) from included studies.


#### 5. Assess Risk of Bias: 

Evaluate the quality of individual studies (e.g., confounding, blinding, attrition).


#### 6. Summarize Evidence: 

Qualitatively describe findings; if data allows, proceed to quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).


#### 7. Reporting: 
Use the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist and flow diagram.

## Meta-Analyses

A meta-analysis is a statistical technique often used within a systematic review to quantitatively combine results from multiple independent studies into a single pooled estimate.


Why conduct one?

  * **Increase Power/Precision:** Pooling sample sizes leads to tighter confidence intervals and greater ability to detect effects.

  * **Synthesize Evidence:** It provides a summary answer when individual studies might be conflicting or too small.




## Meta-Analysis Steps

#### 1. Write systematic review protocol 

#### 2. Search the literature

#### 3. Review titles, abstracts, and full texts

#### 4. Abstract data from included studies

#### 5. Assess risk of bias

#### 6. Assess heterogeneity of measures of association

**Examine forest plot for heterogeneity:**
  
  * each study is one row in the plot
  
  * this plot shows the combined effect estimate, but this is estimated after this initial assessment
  
  * the dashed line corresponds to the pooled estimate
  
  * the solid line corresponds to the null
  
  * most effect estimates are to the left of the null and have a similar value, suggesting litte heterogeneity

  * individual studies' MOAs may differ for a number of reasons: different population characteristics (age, sex, race); year(s) of study; location; participants' symptoms / clinical characteristics; different variables treated as confounders; study design; sample sizes; statistical analyses
  
  
**Test for heterogeneity using a Q-statistic (type of chi-square test)**

It is a weighted sum of squared differences between individual study effects ($MoA_i$) and the summary effect ($MoA_s$).

  * Null  ($H_0$): no heterogeneity among original studies
  
  * Formula: $Q = \sum w_i (MoA_i - MoA_s)^2$
  
  
  
**Interpretation:**  

A significant p-value (typically p < 0.20 or 0.10, not 0.05) indicates significant heterogeneity. 

If $p < 0.2$, reject $H_0$.
  
  
  
**Test for heterogeneity using $I^2$ Statistic:**

$I^2$ Statistic: Describes the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance

Formula: $I^2 = \frac{Q - df}{Q} \times 100$ 

  * (where $df = k-1$ studies) 

**Interpretation:**  $I^2 > 50\%$ suggests substantial heterogeneity

  
  
  
  


#### 7. Obtain pooled measure of association and Conduct any subgroup analyses

You calculate a weighted average: $MoA_s = \frac{\sum (w_i \times MoA_i)}{\sum w_i}$

The definition of the weight ($w_i$) depends on your model choice:

**Fixed Effects Model:**

  * Assumption: All studies estimate a common, underlying effect. Differences are due only to sampling error
  
  * Inference: Applies only to the specific studies in the meta-analysis
  
  * Use when: There is little evidence of heterogeneity ($I^2 < 50\%$)
  
  * Weights: Typically inverse variance ($w_i = 1/v_i$)
  
  
**Random Effects Model:** 

  * Assumption: The true effect size varies across studies. Studies are a random sample of a larger population of studies
  
  * Inference: Generalizes to a hypothetical population of similar studies
  
  * Use when: There is significant heterogeneity ($I^2 > 50\%$) or you wish to generalize broadly
  
  * Weights: Inverse variance plus between-study variance ($w_i^* = 1/(v_i + \tau^2)$) 
  
    * Note: This results in wider confidence intervals and more conservative estimates than fixed effects

  
  
  
  
  
#### 8. Assess publication bias


Visual Check: Look at a **Funnel Plot**

  * X-axis: Treatment effect (e.g., Log OR)
  
  * Y-axis: Precision (e.g., Standard Error or Sample Size)
  
  * Interpretation: In the absence of bias, it should look like a symmetric inverted funnel
  
  * **"File Drawer Problem"** 
  
    * Asymmetry, specifically a "bite" missing from the bottom corner (small, non-significant studies), suggests publication bias—meaning negative/null studies were likely never published

## Key Take-Aways: 

Forest Plots: Be able to identify individual study weights (box size), point estimates, confidence intervals, and the pooled estimate (diamond). Know that crossing the null line (1.0 for ratios, 0 for differences) means non-significance


Model Selection Logic:

  * High Heterogeneity ($I^2 > 50\%$, significant Q): Use Random Effects (or do not pool)
  
  * Low Heterogeneity: Fixed Effects is acceptable



Weighting: Understand that larger studies (smaller variance) get more weight. Random effects models produce more equal weights between small and large studies compared to fixed effects


Subgroup Analysis: Understand this is used to explore sources of heterogeneity (e.g., blinded vs. unblinded trials). 

**Caution: Do not test for statistical significance between subgroups; only compare magnitudes**
