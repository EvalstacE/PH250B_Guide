# Effect Modification and the Sufficient Component Cause Model





## Overview: The Sufficient Component Cause (SCC) Model

The Sufficient Component Cause model, often visualized as "causal pies," provides a framework for understanding biological or causal interaction.

* **Sufficient Cause:** A complete causal mechanism that inevitably produces the disease. It is represented as a full "pie".

* **Component Cause:** An individual slice of the pie. A single factor (e.g., exposure A) is rarely sufficient on its own; it requires other component causes (e.g., genetic susceptibility, other exposures) to complete the pie

* **Causal Interaction Definition:** In this model, two factors **biologically interact** if and only if they act together in the **same sufficient cause** (the same pie) to produce the outcome






## Assessing Interaction using the SCC Model

To determine if interaction exists, we compare the **Observed Joint Effect** of two exposures to the **Expected Joint Effect** derived from their individual effects. The scale we use (Additive vs. Relative) determines whether our statistical assessment aligns with the biological reality of the causal pies.






### Example Scenario
Imagine a population of 1,000 people with four distinct causal mechanisms (pies) operating

* **Pie 1 (Type A):** Requires Exposure A + Unknown Factor 1 (causes 100 cases).

* **Pie 2 (Type B):** Requires Exposure B + Unknown Factor 2 (causes 50 cases).

* **Pie 3 (Interaction):** Requires **Exposure A + Exposure B** + Unknown Factor 3 (causes 50 cases). 

*This represents biological interaction.*

* **Pie 4 (Background):** Requires Unknown Factor 4 (causes 100 cases).





#### Step 1: Calculate Prevalence 

We calculate the disease prevalence under different exposure conditions:

* **Neither A nor B (Background only):** Only Pie 4 operates.

    * Prevalence = $100/1000 = 0.10$
    
* **A only (No B):** Pie 1 and Pie 4 operate.

    * Prevalence = $(100 + 100)/1000 = 0.20$
    
* **B only (No A):** Pie 2 and Pie 4 operate.

    * Prevalence = $(50 + 100)/1000 = 0.15$
    
* **Both A and B:** Pie 1, Pie 2, **Pie 3**, and Pie 4 operate.

    * Prevalence = $(100 + 50 + 50 + 100)/1000 = 0.30$




### Step 2: Assess Interaction on the Additive Scale 

We check if the Risk Differences (RD) add up.

1.  **RD for A alone:** $0.20 - 0.10 = 0.10$

2.  **RD for B alone:** $0.15 - 0.10 = 0.05$

3.  **Expected Joint RD:** $0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15$

4.  **Observed Joint RD:** $0.30 - 0.10 = 0.20$

**Conclusion:** The Observed RD ($0.20$) $\neq$ Expected RD ($0.15$). 

Effect modification is **present** on the additive scale. This correctly identifies the presence of Pie 3 (the biological interaction).





### Step 3: Assess Interaction on the Relative Scale

We check if the Risk Ratios (RR) multiply.

1.  **RR for A alone:** $0.20 / 0.10 = 2.0$

2.  **RR for B alone:** $0.15 / 0.10 = 1.5$

3.  **Expected Joint RR:** $2.0 \times 1.5 = 3.0$

4.  **Observed Joint RR:** $0.30 / 0.10 = 3.0$


**Conclusion:** The Observed RR ($3.0$) $=$ Expected RR ($3.0$). 

Effect modification is **absent** on the relative scale. 

This **fails** to identify the presence of Pie 3 (the biological interaction).





## What happens if we remove the Interaction Pie?

If we remove Pie 3 (the causal interaction) from the population, the prevalence for "Both A and B" drops to 250/1000 ($0.25$)

* **Additive Scale:** Observed RD ($0.15$) now equals Expected RD ($0.15$). 

We correctly conclude **no interaction**

* **Relative Scale:** Observed RR ($2.5$) does **not** equal Expected RR ($3.0$). 

We incorrectly conclude interaction is **present**







## Summary of Key Points

* **Biological Interaction:** 

Corresponds to the co-presence of component causes in the same sufficient cause (pie)


* **Additive Scale:** In the SCC model, a departure from additivity (Observed $\neq$ Expected) implies the presence of causal interactive types (biological interaction)


* **Relative Scale:** Assessing interaction on the relative scale (multiplicative) does not reliably detect biological interaction; it may indicate interaction when none exists biologically, or miss it when it is present
