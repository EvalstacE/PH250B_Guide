# Effect Measure Modification



##  What is Effect Measure Modification?

In this course, we distinguish between three related but distinct concepts often grouped under the term "interaction" It is crucial to use the precise terminology for the exam.

1.  **Statistical Interaction:** A departure from the underlying form of a statistical model (e.g., deviation from linearity or log-linearity). It depends entirely on the scale (additive vs. multiplicative) used in the model.

2.  **Effect Measure Modification (EMM):** Heterogeneity of the effect measure across strata of a third variable. This is the term we use when we observe different estimates of association (e.g., different Odds Ratios) between subgroups.


3.  **Biologic/Causal Interaction:** The interdependence of two causal factors in bringing about an outcome. We often assess this using the **Additive Scale**, as it aligns with the Sufficient Component Cause model and Counterfactual frameworks.

**Key Exam Concept:**

* **Confounding** is a bias we want to adjust for (remove).

* **Effect Modification** is a finding we want to report (describe). It means the biological or public health relationship works differently in different groups. **Do not adjust for an effect modifier; stratify and report it.** 




## Types of Interaction



### 1. Synergism (Positive Interaction)
The joint effect of two exposures is **greater** than the sum (or product) of their independent effects.

* **Interpretation:** The presence of both factors amplifies the risk beyond what we expect from adding them up



### 2. Antagonism (Negative Interaction)
The joint effect of two exposures is **less** than the sum (or product) of their independent effects.

* **Interpretation:** One factor potentially dampens the effect of the other




### 3. Qualitative (Extreme) Interaction

The direction of the association changes across strata.

* **Example:** An exposure is a risk factor in one group ($RR > 1$) but protective in another ($RR < 1$)

* *Note:* This is distinct from simple quantitative interaction where the magnitude changes but the direction remains the same.




## Calculations and Assessment Methods

We assess EMM by comparing the **Observed Joint Effect** to the **Expected Joint Effect** under the assumption of no interaction (homogeneity)



### Method 1: Visual Inspection (Stratification)

Compare the stratum-specific measures of association.

* If $OR_{stratum 1} \approx OR_{stratum 2}$, EMM is likely absent (Homogeneity).

* If $OR_{stratum 1} \neq OR_{stratum 2}$, EMM is likely present (Heterogeneity)



### Method 2: Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity


This statistical test evaluates the null hypothesis that the measure of association is homogeneous (the same) across all strata


* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** $OR_1 = OR_2 = ... = OR_k$

* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** At least one stratum-specific OR is different.

* **Test Statistic Formula ($X^2_{hom}$):**

$$ \chi^2_{hom} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (ln(OR_i) - ln(OR_{adjusted}))^2 $$
    
  * Where $w_i$ is the weight (inverse variance) for stratum $i$.
    
  * Degrees of Freedom ($df$) = $k - 1$ (where $k$ is the number of strata).
    
* **Interpretation:** If $p < 0.05$ (or typically $p < 0.20$ for interaction tests due to low power), we reject the null and conclude EMM is present





### Method 3: Additive Scale Interaction (The Causal Standard)

Many epidemiologists argue that **additive interaction** most closely reflects biological interaction. 

We assess this by looking at **Risk Differences (RD)**.




#### General Rule for Additivity

Interaction is absent if the joint risk difference equals the sum of the individual risk differences:

$$ RD_{11} = RD_{10} + RD_{01} $$

* $RD_{11}$: Risk difference when both exposures are present.

* $RD_{10}$: Risk difference when Exposure A is present, B is absent.

* $RD_{01}$: Risk difference when Exposure B is present, A is absent




#### RERI (Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction)

If you have relative measures (RR or OR) from a regression model but want to assess additive interaction, you calculate RERI.

**Formula:**
$$ RERI = RR_{11} - RR_{10} - RR_{01} + 1 $$

**Interpretation:**

* **RERI > 0:** Positive Interaction (Synergy) on the additive scale.

* **RERI < 0:** Negative Interaction (Antagonism) on the additive scale.

* **RERI = 0:** No Interaction (Additivity holds)




### Method 4: Multiplicative Scale Interaction

This is the default for logistic and log-linear regression models. We assess this by looking at **Ratio Measures (RR, OR)**.

* **No Interaction Rule:** The joint relative risk equals the product of the individual relative risks.
    $$ RR_{11} = RR_{10} \times RR_{01} $$
    
* **Interpretation:** If the observed joint RR differs from the product of the individual RRs, there is multiplicative interaction.





## Assessment in Regression Models

When using multivariable models, interaction is assessed by adding a **product term** ($X_1 \times X_2$).

* **Model:** $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 (X_1 \cdot X_2)$

* **Coefficient $\beta_3$:** Estimates the interaction effect.

    * If $\beta_3 \neq 0$: Interaction is present.
    
    * The scale of interaction depends on the model:
    
        * **Linear Regression:** Tests Additive Interaction
        
        * **Logistic/Log-Linear Regression:** Tests Multiplicative Interaction






## Exam Prep Checklist

**Distinguish concepts:** Can you define the difference between statistical interaction (model-dependent) and biological interaction (additive)?


**Identify the scale:** Are you looking at Risk Differences (Additive) or Risk Ratios (Multiplicative)?


**Calculate RERI:** Be prepared to calculate RERI given a table of RRs or ORs to test for biological interaction.


**Interpret the Chi-Square:** Know that a significant $p$-value in a homogeneity test means the strata are different (EMM exists).


**Identify Confounding vs. EMM:**

* If stratum-specific estimates are similar to each other but different from the crude $\rightarrow$


**Confounding**.

* If stratum-specific estimates are different from each other $\rightarrow$ **Effect Measure Modification**
