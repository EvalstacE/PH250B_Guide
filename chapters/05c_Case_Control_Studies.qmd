# Case-Control Studies


## Key Points

### Three Principles: 

**(1) Study-Base Principle:**

  + cases and controls should be "representative of the same base experience" in order to minimize selection bias
  

**(2) Deconfounding Principle:**

  + the measures of association should NOT be distorted by confounding, unmeasured confounders should be minimized in the study design (e.g. stratification, matching)
  
  
**(3) Comparable Accuracy Principle:**

  + the degree of accuracy in measuring the exposure of interest for the cases should be equivalent to the degree of accuracy for the controls 


Following the three principles for case-control studies outlines by *Wacholder et al.* helps to minimize selection bias, confounding, and information bias

We can use a combination of study design and data analysis techniques to meet these principles, including: 

  + Careful selection of controls
  
  + Matching
  
  + Stratification 
  
  + Multivariate statistical models 
  
  + Validation studies
  
  
**There are many potential types of controls**

  + each type of control has different limitations and advantages
  
  + typically we are restricted in the set of potential types of controls we can use, depending on our exposure and disease of interest 
  
  + when selecting controls, we should try to adhere to the three principles for case-control studies as they apply to our research question
  
  
**Case-control study designs estimate different measures of association**

**Various case-control design features exist to:**

  + reduce the cost of conducting the study
  
  + increase the statistical efficiency (e.g., reduce the width of 95% CI)
  
  + Control for unmeasured confounders

## Primary vs Secondary Study Base

### Primary Study Base:

**Advantages:** 

  + we can be more confident that the controls come from the population that gave rise to the cases
  
  + we can be more confident that exposure in controls estimates the distribution of exposure in the general population 
  
**Disadvantages:**

  + we must consider whether all cases have been identified
  
  + **Controls:** controls from this population may be less motivated to participate, it may be expensive to track down and interview controsl from such a wide poulation base, and differential misclassification of exposure via recall bias may be more of a concern (*note: potential for recall bias is an issue with secondary study bases as well*)
